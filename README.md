## 🔍 Project 1: Customer Segmentation from Drug Sales Data

### 🎯 Objective  
Segment customers based on historical drug sales data to support:
- Targeted marketing  
- Inventory planning  
- Distribution strategies

### 🧠 Approach  
- Utilized **KNIME** for data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization  
- Applied **unsupervised learning** techniques (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)  
- Generated customer profiles based on:
  - Purchasing patterns  
  - Purchase volume and frequency  
  - Product categories

## 🔁 Project 2: Reverse Engineering Formulas from Output to Inputs

### 🎯 Objective  
Predict the required input raw materials (X1, X2, ..., Xn) from desired output characteristics (Y1, Y2, ..., Yn).

### 🧠 Approach  
- Built a KNIME workflow to map outputs back to possible input combinations  
- Applied **regression and optimization** techniques to solve the inverse design problem  
- Improved R&D efficiency by reducing trial-and-error in pharmaceutical formulation
